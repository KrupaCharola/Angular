Event Emitting:

Child component will have functions on actions like edit and Delete 
Functions will emit the event so Parent can listen to it.
To emit child will use property with @output decorator to give data back 
to parent Component.

Parent Component will have a property in Child component declaration for which 
child declared output event.
parent Component will declare a function on that property in which it will receive 
the data that Child sent.
